# Project field mappings (exact names from our Project policy):
project: "test"
-->

## Intent

Document the schema for `project_state.json` and `project_status.md`:

- [ ] stable field names (Status, Track, Phase, Priority)
- [ ] allowed values and mapping rules
- [ ] how parent/child links are represented

## Acceptance

- [ ] `docs/policy/project_export_schema.md` merged and linked from `docs/README.md`.
