## Intent
Document the schema for `project_state.json` and `project_status.md`:
- [ ] stable field names (Status, Track, Phase, Priority)
- [ ] allowed values and mapping rules
- [ ] how parent/child links are represented

## Acceptance
- [ ] `docs/policy/project_export_schema.md` merged and linked from `docs/README.md`.
