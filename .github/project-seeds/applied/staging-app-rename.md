# Streamlit Cloud — rename current app to “staging”

Retitle the existing Streamlit Cloud deployment so the name unmistakably signals **staging**.

## Acceptance

- Streamlit Cloud app name includes “staging”.
- App description clarifies: deploys on **merge to main**; uses **staging** secrets.
- Links in the Project Bible updated (if we store them there).
