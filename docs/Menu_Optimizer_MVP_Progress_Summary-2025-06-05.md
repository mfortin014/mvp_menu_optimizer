# 🍽️ Menu Optimizer – MVP Phase 2 Progress Summary

## ✅ Completed Work

### 🧾 Ingredients Page Overhaul
- Migrated layout to `st.data_editor()` for table rendering.
- Introduced a **Select** column to trigger sidebar form load.
- Sidebar form includes full fields:
  - `ingredient_code`, `name`, `ingredient_type`
  - `package_qty`, `package_uom`, `package_cost`
  - `yield_pct` as a percentage
  - `status` (Active/Inactive)
  - `category_id` via FK with name resolution
- Added form buttons:
  - **Save** – create or update ingredient
  - **Cancel** – clears form and selection
  - **Delete** – soft deletes (status = Inactive)
- Converted `yield_qty` to `yield_pct` (percentage logic)

### 💡 UX Improvements
- Ensured type-safe field handling in `st.number_input()`
- Category names are displayed in table via mapping
- Clean separation between ingredient records and sidebar state

## ⚠️ Outstanding Work

### 🛠 Radio-Style Selection Bug
- Current `Select` column allows multiple selections temporarily.
- Selection logic is inconsistent: the first item selected is sticky.
- Desired behavior (❌ not working yet):
  - When Ingredient A is selected, then Ingredient B is selected,
    Ingredient A should automatically deselect.

> 🧠 May require custom component or future update to Streamlit.

## 🔜 Next Steps
- Improve selection logic (true radio behavior)
- Add optional export features (CSV, XLSX)
- Enhance UX with row highlighting or hover states
- Move on to Recipe Editor CRUD / Cost validation
