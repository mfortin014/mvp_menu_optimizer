# üìä Menu Optimizer ‚Äì MVP Progress Summary (2025-06-13)

## ‚úÖ Key Features Implemented

- **Ingredient Management Page**
  - CRUD operations using form inputs with validation
  - AgGrid table with filtering, sorting, and selection
  - CSV export with rounding and exportable state
  - CSV import with inline validation and duplicate detection

- **Recipe Management Page**
  - Matching layout and functionality with Ingredient page
  - Introduced `recipe_category` column for custom use
  - Switched base_yield_uom input to text for MVP flexibility

- **Reference Data Page**
  - Supports direct table editing for `ref_ingredient_categories`, `ref_uom_conversion`, and `ref_status`
  - Simple, shared UI with edit, add, and inactivate

- **Import System**
  - CSV import with row-level validation and rejection report
  - Skips duplicate `ingredient_code` with source vs DB comparison
  - Exported CSV of rejected rows with reason column

## üîÑ Decisions & Conventions

- No CSV import until recipe categories are finalized
- `base_yield_uom` is freeform for MVP to avoid UOM coupling
- Form validation doesn't currently enforce uniqueness in `recipe_code`‚Äîbut DB does
- Post-MVP improvements planned for:
  - Hierarchical packaging definitions
  - In-app quickfilter clearing in AgGrid
  - Modular multi-object import page

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues to Revisit
- Cancel buttons don't clear the sidebar form in all views
- Supabase outages impacted testing and confidence in status codes
- AgGrid filtering UX could be improved with "clear all filters" support
- Home page: quick access to active ingredients and recipes to be added
