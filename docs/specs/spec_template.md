## 1) Executive summary

**Purpose — one paragraph:** What problem are we solving for whom, and why now? Make it human.  
**Outcome — one sentence:** What must be true when this work is done?

**Meta (edit inline):**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Area | &lt;intake • identity • measure • chronicle • lexicon • ui • db • ci • policy • runbooks&gt; |
| Type | Spec |
| Priority | &lt;P0 • P1 • P2 • P3&gt; |
| Target release | `mvp-<X.Y.Z>` |
| Risk level | &lt;Low • Medium • High&gt; |
| Rollout strategy | &lt;Flag • Staged • Big-bang&gt; |

## 2) Goals and non‑goals

**Goals** (must happen):  
- [ ] …  
- [ ] …  

**Non‑goals** (explicitly *not* doing):  
- …  
- …  

> Note: Non‑goals are guardrails that keep scope honest.

---

## 3) Users & tenants impacted

Who touches this and how? Any multi‑tenant/RLS considerations, permissions, or abuse cases to foresee.

---

## 4) Happy‑path scenarios

Describe the shortest successful journeys. Two or three is plenty.

1. As a &lt;user/tenant&gt;, I … and see …  
2. As a &lt;role&gt;, I … and the system …

> Keep these concise; they become your smoke checks later.

## 5) Out of scope

Bullet the edges that remain out, to prevent scope creep.

- …  
- …

---

## 6) Risks & assumptions

- **Risks:** &lt;what could bite us&gt;  
- **Assumptions:** &lt;what we’re betting on&gt;  
- **Open questions:** &lt;known unknowns&gt;

> If risk is High, consider a feature flag and a rollback plan.

---

## 7) Data & migrations (if any)

- Schema deltas (DDL): describe the **Expand → Migrate → Contract** plan.  
- Backfills (DML): outline idempotent jobs and timing.  
- Snapshots/rollbacks: how to revert safely if needed.

Reference planned scripts under `migrations/sql/` (e.g., `V003__add_tenant_id.sql`). See: [CI/CD Constitution](../policy/ci_cd_constitution.md).

---

## 8) Feature flags (if any)

- **Flag name:** …  
- **Owner:** …  
- **Default:** OFF / ON  
- **Kill switch behavior:** …  
- **Removal date:** …  
- **Cohort rollout:** &lt;tenants • % of traffic&gt;

> Flags let you merge early, release later. Pair with telemetry before widening.

---

## 9) Observability

**Smoke after deploy** (turn into automated checks if possible):  
- [ ] Golden Path loads &lt;page/flow&gt; without error  
- [ ] &lt;Key assertion&gt; succeeds

**Events/metrics to watch:**  
- `event_name` with `tenant_id`, `request_id`, `correlation_id`  
- Error rate, latency, success % for &lt;endpoint/flow&gt;

**Deploy marker:** `mvp-<X.Y.Z>` with commit SHA.

See: [CI/CD Constitution](../policy/ci_cd_constitution.md).

---

## 10) Acceptance bullets (merge‑ready checklist)

- [ ] Users can … (actionable, testable)  
- [ ] UI shows … under … conditions  
- [ ] Flags configured (owner/default/kill switch/removal date)  
- [ ] Migrations shipped as `migrations/sql/V***__*.sql` and idempotent  
- [ ] Observability in place (events/metrics + deploy marker)  
- [ ] Docs updated (README, user docs if relevant)

> Write these like you’ll verify them. Action verbs. No ambiguity.

---

## 11) Rollout plan

**Staging:** deploy on merge to `main`; run smoke; observe for a soak window of &lt;minutes&gt;.  
**Production:** manual approval via GitHub Environment; small tenant cohort first if flagged.  
**Rollback:** criteria and steps if smoke or SLOs fail.

See: [Release Playbook](../runbooks/release_playbook.md).

## 12) Dependencies

Upstream/downstream systems, libraries, data, or other specs. Include links.

- Depends on: …  
- Affects: …

---

## 13) Changelog impact

Will this produce user‑visible changes? If yes, the implementing PRs should add entries to `CHANGELOG.md` under **Added/Changed/Fixed** following [Conventional Commits & Changelog](../policy/commits_and_changelog.md).
