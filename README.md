# Menu Optimizer v1.1 â€“ README

## Overview

This MVP supports Chef's culinary consulting work by allowing them to manage and analyze recipes, ingredient costs, and performance. It is a prototype built in **Streamlit** using a **Supabase** backend. The project will later be migrated to a React + Supabase architecture inside the OpsForge platform.

## Known Issues / To Do

- Ingredient "Select" column behavior not fully radio-style yet
- Recipe breakdown page still uses outdated cost logic
- Ref tables management (e.g., categories, UOM) not yet exposed in UI
- Inline editing in `st.data_editor` is currently disabled for validation consistency
